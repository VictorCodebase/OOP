## What We've Done

We've developed a system with the following functionalities:

- Add different types of tenants
- Remove tenants
- Find tenants
- Display all tenants

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine. You can check this by running `java -version` in your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `.java` files.
3. Compile the Java files using the command `javac FileName.java`.
4. Run the compiled Java program using the command `java FileName`.

Replace `FileName` with the name of the file you want to run.

Please replace the empty fields with the names of the participants.
